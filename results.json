Audibility is good and noise cancellation works great even when there was my kid playing in the background. Very rarely people complain about lost comms due to aggressive noise cancellation. If you are considering these earphones because you are in for a decent pair of earphones that are loud enough, good ANC and budget friendly these are for you.",
